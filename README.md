## Author

**Simple-KeychainSwift** was wrtten by Ashley Mills, ashleymills@mac.com

## License

**Simple-KeychainSwift** is available under the MIT license. See the LICENSE file for more info.

## Example usage

**Simple-KeychainSwift** declares a protocol `TypeSafeKeychainValue`:

```swift
public protocol TypeSafeKeychainValue {
    func data() -> Data?                   // Convert to Data
    static func value(data: Data) -> Self? // Convert from Data
}
```

You can use **Simple-KeychainSwift** to set any types that conform to this protocol. Currently supported are `String`, `Int`, `Bool` and `Date`, To set other types, add conformity to `TypeSafeKeychainValue`, e.g.

```swift
extension Int: TypeSafeKeychainValue {
    public func data() -> Data? {
        var value = self
        return Data(bytes: &value, count: MemoryLayout.size(ofValue: value))
    }
    public static func value(data: Data) -> Int? {
        return data.withUnsafeBytes { $0.pointee }
    }
}
```

### Set a key/value pair

```swift
Keychain.set("some value", forKey: "some string")
Keychain.set(true, forKey: "some bool")
Keychain.set(Date(), forKey: "some date")
Keychain.set(27, forKey: "some int")
```

### Retrieve the value for a key

```swift
Keychain.value(forKey: "some string") as String
Keychain.value(forKey: "some bool") as Bool
Keychain.value(forKey: "some date") as Date
Keychain.value(forKey: "some int") as Int
```

### Delete a key/value pair

`Keychain.removeValue(forKey: "my key")`

### Delete all values from the keychain

`Keychain.reset()`
